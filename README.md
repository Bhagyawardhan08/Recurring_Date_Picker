This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, install all dependencies:
```bash
npm install

```
Then, Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

Reusable Date Picker Component for Recurring Dates
This repository contains a reusable Date Picker component built in React (with Next.js), designed to allow users to select recurring dates, similar to the feature found in the TickTick app.

Features
Recurring Options: Users can select recurring dates with customizable patterns:

Daily
Weekly
Monthly
Yearly


Customization: Fine-tune recurrence options such as:

Every X days/weeks/months/years
Select specific days of the week
Choose the nth day of the month (e.g., the second Tuesday)
Date Range: Users can set a start date and optionally an end date for the recurring pattern.

Visual Preview: A mini-calendar displays the selected recurring dates within the date picker for an intuitive user experience.

Technical Stack
Framework: Next.js
Styling: Tailwind CSS (or your choice of CSS framework)
State Management: Zustand
Development Environment: Cloud-based IDEs such as CodeSandbox
Code Structure
The component is modular and cleanly structured for reusability and maintainability.

Key features include:

The component is broken down into smaller, reusable parts (recurrence options, date picker, preview, etc.).
Clean and well-documented code: Each part of the code is written with clarity, maintainability, and documentation in mind.


Testing
Unit Tests: Individual logic for each component is tested using unit tests.
Integration Test: A comprehensive integration test ensures the component functions as expected.

Screencast
A short screencast (5-10 minutes) is included to demonstrate:

The functionality of the date picker component
A walkthrough of the code structure and design decisions
Note: My face is visible in the screencast, as required.
